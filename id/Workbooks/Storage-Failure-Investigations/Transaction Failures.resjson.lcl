          <Val><![CDATA[### The client is receiving HTTP 403 (Forbidden) messages]A;If your client application is throwing HTTP 403 (Forbidden) errors, a likely cause is that the client is using an expired Shared Access Signature (SAS) when it sends a storage request (although other possible causes include clock skew, invalid keys, and empty headers). If an expired SAS key is the cause, you will not see any entries in the server-side Storage Logging log data.]A;]A;If the issue is related to SAS tokens, you should investigate why the SAS token is expiring before the client sends the token to the server:]A;* Typically, you should not set a start time when you create a SAS for a client to use immediately. If there are small clock differences between the host generating the SAS using the current time and the storage service, then it is possible for the storage service to receive a SAS that is not yet valid.]A;* Do not set a very short expiry time on a SAS. Again, small clock differences between the host generating the SAS and the storage service can lead to a SAS apparently expiring earlier than anticipated.]A;* Does the version parameter in the SAS key (for example sv=2015-04-05) match the version of the Storage Client Library you are using? We recommend that you always use the latest version of the Storage Client Library.]A;* If you regenerate your storage access keys, any existing SAS tokens may be invalidated. This issue may arise if you generate SAS tokens with a long expiry time for client applications to cache.]A;* If you are using the Storage Client Library to generate SAS tokens, then it is easy to build a valid token. However, if you are using the Storage REST API and constructing the SAS tokens by hand, see Delegating Access with a Shared Access Signature.]]></Val>
