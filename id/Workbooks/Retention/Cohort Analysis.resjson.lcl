          <Val><![CDATA[# Cohort Analysis]A;]A;Cohort Analysis measures how many of your users come back to perform one of the `RetainingActivities` in a particular period after they perform one of the `CohortingActivities` in your app - split by a dimension you choose. For instance, you could be measuring the number of users who returned to use your app on the 10th day from the day they first downloaded it, split by the country they are from. Seeing the retention trend for days 1-10 will give you an indication of the stickiness of your app. ]A;]A;Cohort Analysis is similar to N-day or Bracket retention and is only different in how the cohorts are defined. ]A;]A;This type of analysis is well-suited for gaming apps, or other kinds of app where you are trying to get users to develop a daily habit. Cohort Analysis will help you see differences in user retention across standard dimensions like country, app version, etc. or custom dimensions like 'Is Premium Customer' or 'Flight name in an experiment group'.]]></Val>

Example: Users who used event *Read Product Review* (cohorting activity). |]A;| Retaining Activities  | The activities that indicates retention of a cohorted user selected above. Example: Users who used event *Read Product Review* (cohorting activity) and returned to use *Purchase Product* (retaining activity). |]A;| Cohorting/Retaining Filters  | An analytics query snippet to further filter the cohorting activity. Example: *&#124; where application_Version = '1.0'* |]A;| Show  | The metric to visualize in the table. *Retention Rate* shows the rate at which users returned for the time period in the column. *Retained Users* is raw number of retained users for the time period. *Potentially Retainable Users* is the number of users who could potentially have been retained for that period.' |]A;]]></Val>

          <Val><![CDATA[## What is a week for a user?]A;The short answer is that it is unique for each user. Our analysis treats each user's retention window seperately - giving an accurate view of their actual behavior with your app. ]A;]A;Consider the example below of two users X and Y: ]A;]A;| User | First use of app | Weeks for user |]A;| ----- | :----- | :----- |]A;| X | April 3 | w1 = April 10, w2 = April 17, w3 = April 24  |]A;| Y | April 5 | w1 = April 12, w2 = April 19, w3 = April 26  |]A;]A;Each user gets a seperate retention window. So, if both users came back on April 18, then it considered as Week 2 usage for User X but Week 1 usage for User Y. ]A;]A;This allows the normalization their app use over the retention window - making it seem as if all users in a cohort used the app on the same day. This allow for better analysis and comparision of user behavior.]]></Val>
